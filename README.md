Azkarra Streams is a lightweight Java framework which makes easy to develop and operate Kafka Streams applications (Azkarra is Basque word for *"Fast"*) 

_**[Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/)** is a client library for building applications and microservices, where the input and output data are stored in Kafka clusters. 
It combines the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side  with the benefits of Kafka's server-side cluster technology (source: [Apache documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/))._

## üöÄ Features

* Create stand-alone Kafka Streams applications.
* Easy externalization of Topology and Kafka Streams configurations (using Typesafe Config).
* Embedded http server (Undertow).
* Embedded WebUI for topologies visualization.
* Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, dead-letter-queues.
* Encryption and Authentication with SSL or Basic Auth.
